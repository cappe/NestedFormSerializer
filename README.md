# NestedFormSerializer

## TL;DR
1. Serializes nested HTML inputs into JS objects 
2. Deserializes JS objects back to nested HTML inputs

## Motivation
I needed a way to
* convert nested HTML inputs into JS objects
* convert those JS objects back to correct input field names

I couldn't find any simple JS implementation for both of these operations, hence the plugin. In addition, this is my first JS plugin so it is also for practising purposes.

## TODO
* Support for all input types
* Support for custom options
* Improve README by adding documentation and examples
* Test suite
